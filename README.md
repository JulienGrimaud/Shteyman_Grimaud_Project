# Shteyman_Grimaud_Project
This code was written in conjuction of a project between Gary Shteyman and Dr. Julien Grimaud. The initial purpose of the code was to analyze a matrix of neuronal recordings, add up a list of variables, and compare said variables.
Each script comes with comments that should help you implement your own research, and better understand the script. Please note, odor_neuron_similarity cannot run without the other scripts, and an initial data set is required. Enjoy!
